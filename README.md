The animation shows real-world scenarios where motion continues or stops in the absence or presence of external forces.

## 📌 Features

- Demonstrates:
  - Motion of objects with no external force
  - Inertia of rest and motion
  - Real-life examples (sliding ball, moving cart, etc.)

- Simple and classroom-friendly animation

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- [Manim](https://www.manim.community/)
- Python 3.10+
- FFmpeg

## 🔧 How to Run

1. Clone the repo:
